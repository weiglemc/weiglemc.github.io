I am a **Professor of Computer Science** at [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/).  I serve as the **Assistant Chair for Graduate Programs and Research** and the **Graduate Program Director (GPD) for the PhD Program** in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.odu.edu/computer-science).  See our website for information on our graduate programs ([MS](https://www.odu.edu/computer-science/academics/graduate/masters), [PhD](https://www.odu.edu/computer-science/academics/graduate/phd)). If you need to contact a CS GPD, please use [csgpd@odu.edu](mailto:csgpd@odu.edu).

For an overview of my research over the past few years, see [On the importance of web archiving](https://items.ssrc.org/parameters/on-the-importance-of-web-archiving/), an article I wrote for [*SSRC Parameters*](https://items.ssrc.org/category/parameters/) in 2018. I recently gave an [interview covering my background, our research group, and challenges facing web archive collections](https://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/2022/11/10/whats-in-a-web-archive-collection-summarization-and-discovery-of-archived-webpages/) for the National Library of Medicine's [*Circulating Now* blog](https://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/). I'm currently featured on the [ODU Faculty Women in STEM page](https://www.odu.edu/facultydevelopment/women-in-stem#tab9=3&done1612907281342), where you can read a bit more about my background and experiences as a woman in computer science. For more information on my education and work experience, see my [bio](#bio).
